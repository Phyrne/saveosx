The Save OSX Project:
======================


# Goal:

Our goal is, as hobbyists, to make the Mac OS X system more suited to power users used to minimalistic environments.

We want to bring the real power of OS X to the user in a convenient and clean manner while still having a stable OS for daily usage


# The issue:

Apple's Mac OS X has great underlying features and great tools taken 
from the FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD projects such as PF and various 
commands but the gui is intended at average users with no desire to 
use the said tools.

There are already lots of great applications available on the system 
to remediate that problems such as Apple open source's X11: Xquartz 
and the MacPorts package system that brings thousands of various 
programs which we will mainly use during the project.

The problem is that there are way too much services enabled that the 
common Unix geek wouldn't use and often wants to see gone when looking 
at a top or ps command. These services often use lots of resources 
and running Mountain Lion on old MacBooks can be a bit annoying. 

What we want is to use Mac OS X, a system perfectly tailored for Apple's 
hardware and still be able to run a minimalistic system that would please
the average BSD or GNU/Linux user :) So we need people to contribute
hacks, code; anything to get rid of OS X' clutter.
