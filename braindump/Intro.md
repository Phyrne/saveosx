The Save OSX Project:
======================


# The Goal:

Our goal is to make the Mac OS X operating system more suited to power users used to minimalistic environments (where *nix users will feel at home).

We want to bring the real power of OS X to the user in a convenient and clean manner whilst still having a stable OS for daily use.


# The issue:

Apple's Mac OS X has some great underlying features and some solid tools, such as PF & other nifty programs taken from various projects, including FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. But the GUI is intended for average users with no desire to use said tools and we feel it just gets in the way.

There are already lots of great applications available on the system to remediate these problems, such as Apple Open Source's X11: Xquartz and the MacPorts package system that brings thousands of programs which we will mainly use during the project.

The problem is that there are far too many services running by default that the common UNIX geek wouldn't use and often wants to see gone when looking at top or ps. These services often hog resources and running Mountain Lion on older machines can be a bit taxing.

What we want is to use Mac OS X, a system perfectly tailored for Apple's hardware and still be able to run a minimalistic system that would please the average BSD or GNU/Linux user :) 

Also, if you feel you have something worth contributing; hacks, code, anything to get rid of OS X' clutter, then please contact us, this is a hobbyist project after all and we're happy to listen to anything the community has to offer!
