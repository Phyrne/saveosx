Welcome to the Save OS X project, an effort to make OS X
a more comfortable system for hackers, developers & power users.

This script will set up your environment for you. It will automatically
install pkgsrc & its associated binary package manager - pkgin.
You will also have the choice to apply a seamless X11 environment that
we've hacked up for you!

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"pkgsrc"$ESC""`
pkgsrc is a framework for building third-party software on NetBSD and other UNIX-like systems,
currently containing over 12000 packages. It is used to enable freely available software to be
configured and built easily on supported platforms.

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"pkgin"$ESC""`
The pkgin command is aimed at being an apt/yum like tool for managing pkgsrc binary packages.
It relies on pkg_summary(5) for installation, removal and upgrade ofpackages and associated 
dependencies, using a remote repository.

Proceeding to download and install pkgsrc/pkgin tools....

cat << EOM

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"Xquartz"$ESC""`
XQuartz is an open-source effort to develop a version of the X.Org X Window System that runs on OS X.
Together with supporting libraries and applications, it forms the X11.app that Apple has shipped with
OS X since version 10.5.

`echo -e ""$YELLOW_UL"X11 Hacks"$ESC""`
We've cooked up some hacks for OS X in an attempt to seamlessly implement an X11 environment,
close to how it would be on any other UNIX-like system. This is achieved using a mixture of
some custom launchd scripts, so X launches upon login, and some Aqua UI trickery to hide some
elements.
Coupling the above with the wealth of window managers & desktop environments available in our
package repo, you'll feel right at home!

All processes are complete! So what now? Well, we reccomend you read the

with this excellent package manager.

From here, if you opte for X, get your environment set up, and more importantly; enjoy!
